# Next

This project started as wanting to learn more about HTTP and JavaFX but I messed a bit too much with it.

So I want to rewrite the whole GUI using [JCEF](https://github.com/chromiumembedded/java-cef)

# Will allow me to do:

- Spotify SDK then I can stream music from it
- Use javascript or even javascript frameworks to render GUI
- why not
